# Concurrency Theory

This repository contains exercises for the **Concurrency Theory** course, focusing on practical implementations and analysis of concurrent systems.

## Exercises

1. **Dining Philosophers Problem**  
   Compare different solutions and implementations of the classic five philosophers problem.

2. **Trace Theory & Graph Grammars**  
   - Use trace theory for thread scheduling.  
   - Represent concurrent threads using graph grammars, where production execution models thread execution.  
   - Example: transaction sequences modifying variables.  
   - Explore automation techniques for creating Foaty classes and Diekert graphs using trace analysis.

3. **Concurrent Linear Algebra Algorithms**  
   - Apply trace theory for thread scheduling in classical linear algebra algorithms.  
   - Example: concurrent Gaussian elimination.  
   - Requires basic knowledge of concurrent programming and linear algebra.

## Features

- Practical examples of concurrency control and scheduling  
- Analysis of thread interactions using formal methods  
- Implementation of concurrent algorithms
